# Arctic Engine

### Designed to give you control and not take anything away.

Arctic Engine is an open-source free game engine released under the MIT license. Arctic Engine is implemented in C++ and focuses on simplicity.

Many developers have forgotten exactly why it is that we make games. It's joyless, disillusioning and discouraging for them.

In the 80's and 90's it was possible for a programmer to make a game alone and it was Fun.

Arctic Engine returns the power to the C++ programmer and makes game development fun again.
